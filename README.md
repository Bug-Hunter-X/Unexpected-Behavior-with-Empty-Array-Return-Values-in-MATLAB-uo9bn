# MATLAB Bug: Silent Empty Array Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in MATLAB related to the implicit handling of empty array return values from functions. The bug arises when a function returns an empty array, leading to unexpected behavior if this condition isn't explicitly handled by the calling code. 

## Bug Description

The `bug.m` file contains a MATLAB function that may return an empty array under certain conditions.  This empty return value is not explicitly handled in the calling code, leading to potential errors or unexpected program flow.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file showcases how to explicitly check for empty array outputs using `isempty()` function to prevent unexpected behavior and improve code robustness.
